            <p>
              Techino is a start up promising company that focus on meeting the
              business need with the best technical solution. We recently
              launched a Kickstarter campaign to complete 3D printing of our
              custom 1+3+3+5mm HVDC tank with two different metals. We already
              have a factory in Poland that has 3D printed a 3d print of our
              T-Rex tank for 2,000 yuan. Since the production of the new tank
              will include a larger number of tanks, we are able to deliver them
              fast. Our mission is to create a durable, durable tank that can be
              ordered as a one use tool in all industries and are even suitable
              for military applications. We are very excited to see who can make
              it, and are working to build quality products, such as our 3D
              printed T-Rex tank. About the 3D Printed HVDC Tank: The T-Rex is a
              4.5mm tank with a thickness between .5-1.5mm.
